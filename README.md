Hereâ€™s a structured overview of integration based on your outline:

### **INTEGRATION**

1. **Definite and Indefinite Integrals**:
   - **Definite Integrals**: Calculate the area under the curve of a function over a specific interval \([a, b]\). Denoted as:
     \[
     \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx
     \]
   - **Indefinite Integrals**: Represent a family of functions (primitive functions) whose derivative is \(f(x)\). Denoted as:
     \[
     \int f(x) \, dx = F(x) + C
     \]
   where \(C\) is the constant of integration.

2. **Primitive Function**:
   - The primitive function \(F(x)\) satisfies \(F'(x) = f(x)\).

3. **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**:
   - Connects differentiation and integration, stating that if \(F\) is the primitive function of \(f\) on \([a, b]\), then:
     \[
     \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)
     \]

4. **Basic Integration Formulas**:
   - Familiarize with the derivatives of basic functions to find their primitives. For example:
     - \(\int x^n \, dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C\) (for \(n \neq -1\))
     - \(\int e^x \, dx = e^x + C\)

5. **Integration Rules**:
   - Use appropriate rules based on the form of the function. Key rules include:
     - **Linearity**: \(\int (af(x) + bg(x)) \, dx = a\int f(x) \, dx + b\int g(x) \, dx\)

6. **Integration by Parts**:
   - Derived from the product rule:
     \[
     \int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du
     \]
   - Useful for integrating products of functions.

7. **Integration of Composite Functions**:
   - Complex due to the nature of composite functions. Often requires substitution or specific techniques.

8. **Integration by Substitution**:
   - Replace parts of the integrand with a new variable \(u\):
     \[
     \int f(g(x)) g'(x) \, dx = \int f(u) \, du
     \]

9. **Partial Fractions**:
   - Decompose rational functions into simpler fractions to facilitate integration. If \(R(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\), factor \(Q(x)\) and express \(R(x)\) as a sum of simpler fractions.

10. **Integrating Rational Functions**:
    - Often involves partial fraction decomposition followed by integration.

11. **Polynomial Division**:
    - Similar to long division, used to simplify integrands before integration.

12. **Integration of Trigonometric Functions**:
    - Techniques include using identities and substitutions to handle integrals involving trigonometric functions.

13. **Tangent Half-Angle Substitution**:
    - Use \(u = \tan\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\) to simplify integrals involving \(\sin x\) and \(\cos x\).

14. **Improper Integrals**:
    - Integrals that extend to infinity or have infinite discontinuities. They require limits for evaluation:
    \[
    \int_{a}^{\infty} f(x) \, dx = \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx
    \]

15. **Definite Integral**:
    - Specifically focuses on calculating the area under the curve for defined limits, combining results from the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
