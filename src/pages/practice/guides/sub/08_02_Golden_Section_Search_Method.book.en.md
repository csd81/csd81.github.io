## 8.2. Golden Section Search Method

Let $f\colon [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be continuous, and suppose that it is a *unimodal function*, i.e., it has a unique minimum point in the interval $[a, b]$. This holds if, e.g., the function is convex on $[a, b]$, but it is not necessary (see, e.g. the second and third functions in Figure 8.1). Let $p$ be the (unique) minimum point of $f$.

![Figure 8.1: Unimodal functions](figure-8-1.png)

*Figure 8.1: Unimodal functions*

The *golden section search method* is similar to the bisection method in the sense that we define a sequence of nested intervals which all contains the minimum point $p$ of $f$: Let $a < y < x < b$. If $f(x) > f(y)$, then $p \in [a, x]$, otherwise $p \in [y, b]$ holds. (See Figure 8.2.) Then we repeat the procedure with the interval $[a, x]$ or $[y, b]$.

![Figure 8.2](figure-8-2.png)

*Figure 8.2:*

We define the points $x$ and $y$ so that the length of the intervals $[a, x]$ and $[y, b]$ be the same: $x - a = b - y = r(b - a)$ for some $0 < r < 1$. Then

$$x = a + r(b - a), \qquad y = a + (1 - r)(b - a) \tag{8.2}$$

hold. The assumption $x > y$ implies that $0.5 < r < 1$ must be satisfied. We denote the next interval by $[a', b']$. We specify the next mesh points $x'$ and $y'$ by the rule (8.2), and comparing the functions values $f(x')$ and $f(y')$ we determine the next interval. We have not defined the ratio $r$ yet. In case of the golden section search method, $r$ is defined so that one of the new mesh points $x'$ and $y'$ should coincide with one of the previous mesh points in order in each steps we should evaluate only one new function value.

![Figure 8.3](figure-8-3.png)

*Figure 8.3:*

Figure 8.3 demonstrates the situation when in the next step the minimum point is located in the right interval $[y, b]$. Then we require that $y' = x$ be a mesh point in the next step. Then the following relations are satisfied:

$$\begin{aligned}
a + r(b - a) &= y' \\
&= a' + (1 - r)(b' - a') \\
&= y + (1 - r)(b - y) \\
&= a + (1 - r)(b - a) + (1 - r)(b - a - (1 - r)(b - a)),
\end{aligned}$$

and so

$$r = 1 - r + (1 - r)(1 - (1 - r)),$$

which yields equation

$$r^2 + r - 1 = 0 \tag{8.3}$$

for the ratio $r$. Its positive solution is $r = (\sqrt{5} - 1)/2 \approx 0.61834$. This is the ratio of the *golden section*, since $r$ satisfies the equation

$$\frac{r}{1 - r} = \frac{1}{r}.$$

In the opposite case when the minimum point is located in the interval $[a, x]$, and we select $x'$ and $y'$ so that $x' = y$ be satisfied. It can be shown easily (see Exercise 3) that this yields the same equation (8.3).

The next result can be shown.

**Theorem 8.4.** *Let $f \in C[a, b]$ be a unimodal function. Then the golden section search method converges to the minimum point of the function $f$.*

It is easy to compute that the length of the interval after $n$ steps is $(b - a)r^n$. Hence to reach $\varepsilon$ tolerance in Algorithm 8.3

$$n \geq \frac{\log \frac{\varepsilon}{b - a}}{\log r} \tag{8.4}$$

steps are required.

**Example 8.5.** Find the minimum point of the function $f(x) = x^2 - 0.8x + 1$. It can be easily checked that its minimum point is $p = 0.4$. We applied Algorithm 8.3 with the starting interval $[-1, 2]$ and tolerance $\varepsilon = 0.005$. Formula (8.4) yields that $n \geq 13.29337586$ steps are needed to reach the required precision. The corresponding numerical results can be seen in Table 8.1. Therefore, the minimum point is located in the interval $[0.3977741449, 0.4013328688]$. The Algorithm 8.3 is formulated so that its output is the midpoint of the last interval, i.e., $0.3995535068$. $\quad\square$

**Exercises**

1. Approximate the minimum point of the following functions using the golden section search method on the given interval:

   (a) $f(x) = x^3 - 3x + 1$, $\quad x \in [-1, 2]$, (b) $f(x) = |\cos x|$, $\quad x \in [0, 2]$,

   (c) $f(x) = 1 - 10xe^{-x}$, $\quad x \in [0, 2]$, (d) $f(x) = \cos(x^2 - x)$, $\quad x \in [1, 3]$.

2. Apply the golden section search method for the function $f(x) = -1/x^2$ on the interval $[-1, 1]$. What do you observe?
